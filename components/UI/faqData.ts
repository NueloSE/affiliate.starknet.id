As an affiliate you'll get access to ready to use designs, news in advance, a special analytics dashboard and a dedicated affiliate manager to optimize your campaigns as much as possible (join the telegram group to do so). The only thing you need to do to start is to copy paste your affiliate link and share it with your audience. You can find your affiliate link in your Affiliate Space.",
